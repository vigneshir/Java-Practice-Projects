/*
Write a program Birthday.java that takes two integer command-line arguments n and trials and performs the following experiment, trials times:

Choose a birthday for the next person, uniformly at random between 0 and nâˆ’1.
Have that person enter the room.
If that person shares a birthday with someone else in the room, stop; otherwise repeat.

In each experiment, count the number of people that enter the room.
Print a table that summarizes the results (the count i, the number of times that exactly i people enter the room, and the fraction of times that i or
fewer people enter the room) for each possible value of i from 1 until the fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
